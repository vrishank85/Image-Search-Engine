**Image Search Engine Application**

I developed an Image Search Engine Application as a personal project, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface. The core functionality of the application revolves around enabling users to search for images based on their preferences through a search bar.

**Technologies Used:**

- **HTML:** Structured the layout and content of the application.
- **CSS:** Designed the visual elements, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented the logic for fetching and displaying images dynamically.

**Key Features:**

1. **Search Bar:** Implemented a search bar that allows users to enter keywords for the images they want to find.
2. **API Integration:** Utilized the Unsplash API to fetch a wide variety of high-quality images based on user queries.
3. **Dynamic Loading:** Implemented dynamic loading of search results, ensuring a seamless user experience without page reloads.
5. **Image Grid:** Displayed the search results in an organized grid layout, optimizing the visual presentation of images.
6. **Preview and Details:** Implemented features for users to preview images and view detailed information such as image dimensions, author, and download options.
7. **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling to gracefully manage scenarios such as API failures or invalid search queries, providing informative feedback to users.

**Project Outcome:**

The Image Search Engine Application showcases my skills in front-end development and API integration. It demonstrates my ability to create a functional and visually appealing web application that enhances user interaction and experience. The project also reflects my attention to detail, as I focused on responsive design principles and error handling to ensure a robust and user-friendly application.

**Achievements and Learnings:**
